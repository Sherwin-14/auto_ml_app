# Welcome to DataStream 

Welcome to the official documentation for DataStream, a powerful tool designed for data analysts. With DataStream, you can upload datasets, perform automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), train Machine Learning (ML) models for both classification and regression problems, compare model performances, and visualize your data interactively. This documentation will guide you through all the features and functionalities of DataStream. Let's get started!

## Upload Your Dataset

The **Upload** feature allows you to import your dataset into the application. You can upload your dataset in CSV format, and the application will read and store your data for further processing. This feature makes it easy to bring your data into the application, setting the stage for the subsequent steps in your machine learning pipeline.

## Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **Automated EDA** feature leverages the power of Pandas Profiling to generate an exploratory data analysis report automatically. With just a few clicks, you can get a comprehensive overview of your data, including descriptive statistics and visualizations. This feature saves you time and effort in understanding your data.

## Train Your Model

The **Train Your Model** feature uses PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python, to train a model on your data. You can select your target feature and the type of problem (classification or regression), and the application will automatically train a model using PyCaret's compare_models function. This feature simplifies the model training process, making machine learning more accessible.

## Download Your Model

Once your model is trained, the **Download Your Model** feature allows you to download your trained model in pickle format. This feature enables you to use your trained model outside of the application, such as in a different project or application.

## Visualize Your Data

The **Visualize Your Data** feature provides an interactive data visualization interface. You can explore your data visually, which can help you gain insights and understand patterns in your data.
