# Model Building

The Model Building feature in the application uses PyCaret to automatically build a predictive model based on your dataset. Here’s how to use this feature:

    1. Navigate to the "Model Building" section in the sidebar.
    2. Select the type of problem you're trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.).
    3. Choose the target column in your dataset that you want to predict or classify.
    4. The application will then use PyCaret to automatically train a model on your data. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your dataset and the complexity of the model.
    5. Once the model is built, the application will display a summary of the model's performance metrics for you to review.

**Remember, the quality of your model will depend on the quality of your data. Make sure your data is clean, well-structured, and appropriately preprocessed for the best results.**

# Downloading the Model

After building your model, you can download it for further use. Here’s how to download your model:

    1. Navigate to the "Download" section in the sidebar.
    2. Click on the "Download Your Model" button.
    3. A file dialog will open. Choose the location where you want to save the model.
    4. Once you select the location and click "Save", the model will be downloaded to your chosen location.

**Remember, the downloaded model will be in a format compatible with PyCaret. You can load this model into a Python environment using PyCaret for further analysis or prediction tasks.**
